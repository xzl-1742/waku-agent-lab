"""Build lab/pi-agent/whiteboards/pi-vs-claude-code.excalidraw — the comparison board.

One poster-tight landscape frame: two harness boundaries side by side, eight
aligned rows each, then the waku punchline. Facts are sourced on the board
itself (standing rule); the architecture deep-dive lives in
pi-architecture.excalidraw — this board only argues the philosophy split.

Run:  python lab/pi-agent/build_pi_vs_claude.py
