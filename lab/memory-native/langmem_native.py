"""LangMem on its own terms: a library, not a service. There is no console.

    ─────────────────────────────────────────────
    THE MANAGER · Job 1 DECIDE
    The store here is a dict. The MANAGER is the entire product: it reads the
    whole conversation and decides three sentences are worth two memories.


    pip install langmem langgraph   # or: uv pip install -e '.[arena]'
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...    # the extractor is an LLM call
    python lab/memory-native/langmem_native.py

SDK: langmem 0.0.30 + langgraph 1.2.10. Verified live 2026-08-12.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS

LangMem sits in every "AI memory tools" listicle next to two hosted products,
and that placement is misleading. It is a set of LangGraph primitives you run
inside your own process. There is no dashboard to open, no account, and by
default no persistence at all -- the store lives in RAM and dies when Python
exits. Step 5 demonstrates that rather than asserting it.

This is also why waku's arena reports LangMem as "unreadable" rather than
"0 facts": every read through the adapter constructs a fresh empty store, and
calling that zero would be a true statement about the wrong object.

Nothing here imports waku.
