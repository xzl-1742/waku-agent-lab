"""Supabase pgvector on its own terms: roll your own, and see what you get.

    ─────────────────────────────────────────────
    THE STORE · Q2 RETRIEVAL (vector)  —  and NO MANAGER AT ALL
    This is the baseline that makes the manager visible by its absence: real
    embeddings, good retrieval, and nothing that ever decides a fact died.


    pip install supabase openai   # or, from the repo root: uv pip install -e '.[arena]'
    export SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_KEY=... OPENAI_API_KEY=...
    python lab/memory-native/supabase_native.py

SDK: supabase-py 2.x + openai 2.51.0. NOT RUN BY US, and deliberately so: the
only Supabase project on this account is a production database, and a demo
table does not belong in one. Kept because plenty of readers already have a
spare project, and this is the honest baseline the other three are measured
against. Run it yourself and the header should say so.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS

Most people reading this already have a Supabase project open in another tab,
and the honest question about the three products in this folder is: what do
they give you that thirty lines of pgvector does not?

This file is the baseline that makes that question answerable. It is a table,
an embedding call, and a cosine search. It works, and it will answer the
paraphrase and the Chinese question better than a keyword index will.

What it does NOT do is the whole point:

  - nothing decides what is worth keeping (mem0 does)
  - nothing notices that fact 3 contradicts fact 2 (Zep does)
  - nothing ever forgets, so contradictions accumulate as neighbours forever

A vector table is retrieval. A memory system is retrieval plus judgement about
what to store and what is no longer true. Step 4 shows the gap.

SETUP -- run this once in the Supabase SQL editor:

    create extension if not exists vector;
    create table quickstart_memories (
      id bigserial primary key,
      content text not null,
      embedding vector(1536),
      created_at timestamptz default now()
    );
    create or replace function match_quickstart_memories(
      query_embedding vector(1536), match_count int
    ) returns table (id bigint, content text, similarity float)
    language sql stable as $$
      select id, content, 1 - (embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
      from quickstart_memories
      order by embedding <=> query_embedding
      limit match_count;
    $$;

Nothing here imports waku.
