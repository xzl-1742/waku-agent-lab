    keeps a lifecycle_state and a pointer to the row that replaced it.

    export MEM0_API_KEY=...
    python lab/memory-native/mem0_native.py

SDK: mem0ai 2.0.17. Verified live 2026-08-12.

Note the reads below pass `filters={"user_id": ...}, version="v2"`. Passing
`user_id=` top-level works for add() and raises on get_all() -- the SDK is
explicit about it, but only once you run it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS

Waku's arena drives mem0 through a common FactStore interface, and to satisfy
that interface it has to call `add(..., infer=False)` -- because the contract
says a write must always store exactly what it was given. That switch turns OFF
the single thing mem0 is actually for.

So this file is the opposite of the arena. Nothing but mem0, extraction left
on, no abstraction in the way. Step 3 is the one to watch: you will say one
thing and find a different thing stored. That is the product, not a bug.

Nothing here imports waku.

    # 2. READ BACK RAW. The money shot: compare this list against the list

    # 4. THE CONTRADICTION -- and the trap.
    #
    #    mem0 DOES resolve this. The May row gets lifecycle_state="superseded"
    #    and replaced_by=<the June row's id>. But get_all() returns NEITHER
    #    field, so reading the list above tells you nothing is wrong. You only
    #    see it by fetching a row on its own, which is what _state() does.
    #
    #    Worse: search() returns the superseded row anyway, and on a real run
    #    it scored HIGHER than the live one (0.3338 vs 0.3307). Which answer
    #    you get is scoring noise. Ask twice, get two answers, same language.
    print("\n-- the superseded fact ----------------------------------------")
    for row in rows:
        state = _state(client, row)
        if state == "superseded":
            print(f"  {row.get('memory')}")

    print("  A plain search still returns it. If you do not read lifecycle_state,")

    """Wait for extraction to go QUIET, not for a count.

    add() returns before the memory exists. Against an account that already
    had rows this is invisible -- you read the OLD ones and everything looks
    fine. Against a freshly wiped account it is brutal: every read comes back
    empty and the store looks broken. Zep documents this loudly; mem0 does
    not, and has no processed flag, which makes it the more dangerous of the
    two -- the failure only appears on a clean run, which is exactly the run
    a benchmark starts from.

    The obvious fix is to wait for len(FACTS) rows. That is wrong, and it
    cost a whole run to learn why: an inferring store decides for itself how
    many memories your sentences become. Three sentences here became four,
    and waiting for three returned the instant BEFORE "moved to June" landed
    -- so the read showed May as active with no June anywhere, while a search
    seconds later happily returned June. A benchmark that stopped there would
    have published "mem0 lost the correction".

    You cannot predict the count. So wait for the count to stop CHANGING.
