"""Zep on its own terms: a temporal knowledge graph.

    THE STORE · Q1 SHAPE (graph)  +  THE MANAGER · Job 2 RETIRE
    The only backend here that answers Q1 with something other than rows or
    files — and the only one that retires a fact by stamping a time on it.


    pip install zep-cloud        # or, from the repo root: uv pip install -e '.[arena]'

SDK: zep-cloud 3.27.0. Verified live 2026-08-12.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS

Every other store in this folder keeps a list and ranks it. Zep decomposes what
you say into entities and edges, and stamps each edge with a VALIDITY INTERVAL.
When you correct yourself, the old edge is not out-ranked -- it is marked
invalid from a point in time, and it stays queryable as history.

Step 4 is why this file is longer than the others. It is the only place in this
folder where "the launch moved to June" does something structurally different
from appending a row.

Two things nobody tells you, both of which will make you think Zep forgot:

  1. INGESTION IS ASYNCHRONOUS. graph.add returns in ~0.2s with
     processed=False. Query immediately and you get nothing. This script waits.
  2. SEARCH RETURNS ZEP'S RENDERING of an edge or node, not the sentence you
     sent. The answers read differently from every other backend here even
     when they are equally correct.

Nothing here imports waku.

def _wait_until_processed(client) -> None:
    """Poll until Zep says it has filed everything we have sent so far.

    Without this the next read is a coin flip, and a fast machine loses it
    more often than a slow one.

    Two wrong versions preceded this one, and both produced the same lie.

    The first waited on the uuid that graph.add() returned, which never
    matches anything episode.get_by_user_id() comes back with, so it burned
    the full timeout every call and then read the graph early.

    The second waited for every episode to report processed=True. That looked
    obviously correct and is still not enough: on a clean project the episodes
    all said processed while the launch facts had produced NO nodes at all, so
    the graph answered "when is the launch?" with the Lisbon meetup and a
    benchmark would have scored Zep as having forgotten a fact it was
    mid-way through filing. `processed` describes the EPISODE, not the graph
    derived from it.

    So: processed on every episode, AND a node count that has stopped moving.
    mem0 needs the same treatment for the same reason and offers no flag at
    all. The lesson generalises past both of them -- on any store that infers,
    "ingested" and "queryable" are different events, and only one of them is
    reported to you.
