"""Semantic memory, vector edition — the Supabase pgvector upgrade path.

Same interface as SqliteFactStore, different retrieval: real embeddings and
cosine similarity instead of keyword BM25. Uses the exact schema and
`match_chunks` RPC from launch-rag / launch-agentic-rag
(github.com/ShenSeanChen/launch-agentic-rag) — if you followed those videos,
this is the same table. Run sql/init_supabase.sql on a fresh project, then:

    pip install 'waku-agent[supabase]'
    WAKU_SEMANTIC_STORE=supabase  SUPABASE_URL=...  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=...
    OPENAI_API_KEY=...   # embeddings only (text-embedding-3-small, 1536d)

When is this worth it over FTS5? When phrasing diverges from wording:
"my business partner" should find "Alex is my cofounder". Keywords can't;
vectors can. For a few hundred personal facts, both are instant.

    # --- CRUD ----------------------------------------------------------------
    # These four went missing until 2026-08-08 and nothing noticed, because
    # nothing described what a fact store owes its callers. See
    # semantic/base.py: the dashboard's memory page and manage_memory's
    # update/delete raised AttributeError here, and search_with_ids was worse —
    # a `hasattr` guard upstream turned it into "no matching facts" while the
    # facts sat in this table.
    #
    # Two schema notes, both inherited from launch-rag and neither obvious:
    #
    #   * `source` is the SUBJECT here, not provenance. SqliteFactStore keeps
    #     them apart (subject="alex", source="consolidation"); rag_chunks has
    #     one column and add() puts the subject in it. So `list()` below cannot
    #     report who claimed a fact. The protocol only promises id/subject/
    #     content, so this is honest rather than broken — but it is why the
    #     dashboard's provenance column is blank on this backend.
    #   * ids: rag_chunks has BOTH `id BIGSERIAL` and `chunk_id TEXT`. We expose
    #     the integer, because dashboard.py does `int(payload["id"])` and would
    #     reject a string outright. Strings are still accepted on the way back
    #     in (matched against chunk_id) the same way memory_admin coerces
    #     Notion's page ids — by shape, not by parsing.
