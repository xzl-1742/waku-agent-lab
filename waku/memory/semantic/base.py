"""The contract every semantic-memory backend has to honour.

Waku is meant to be indifferent to *where* facts live — SQLite on your laptop,
pgvector in Supabase, a hosted memory API. Everything upstream just says "store
this" and "find that". That indifference only works if every backend can do the
same six things, and until this file existed, nothing checked.

It didn't check, so it broke. `SqliteFactStore` implemented six methods;
`SupabaseFactStore` implemented two. Switching backends then produced three
different failures, and the first one is the kind Waku keeps shipping:

  * `list()`      → AttributeError, dashboard memory page 500s
  * `update()`
    `delete()`    → AttributeError, from both the dashboard and manage_memory
  * `search_with_ids()` → worse. The call site guarded it with
    `hasattr(...) else []`, so the agent received an empty list and told the
    user "no matching facts" — while the facts sat in the database. No error,
    no trace, no way to notice. A guard around a missing method doesn't prevent
    a bug; it converts a loud one into a silent lie.

That is the third silent failure in this codebase in two weeks (see
consolidation.py's max_tokens note and store.py's `_fts_query` docstring for
the other two). The pattern is always the same shape: a fallback that looks
defensive and quietly answers wrong. A Protocol is how you stop writing them —
the conformance suite in evals/deterministic/test_fact_store_conformance.py
runs against *every* backend, so a store that can't do the job fails in CI
instead of in front of a user.

Ids are `int | str` on purpose. SQLite rows are integers, but the Supabase
table is keyed by a `chunk_id` string (`fact-a1b2c3…`) inherited from
launch-rag, and a hosted API will hand back whatever it likes. The episodic
side already settled this — `memory_admin.py` coerces by shape — so the
semantic side matches rather than inventing a second convention.

    to its default when the variable is MISSING. So a blank "Settle seconds" box
    produced `float("")` and took every Zep call down with it, while a blank
    "User id" would have silently scoped the graph to "" instead of "waku".

        A local store returns True immediately — for sqlite the write and the
        index are the same transaction. The hosted ones are eventually
        consistent, and both of them mislead you about it:

          - mem0 has no readiness signal at all. add() returns in under a
            second; a live measurement put the row 14s away from being
            queryable.
          - Zep exposes Episode.processed, which is necessary and NOT
            sufficient. Every episode reported processed while the graph
            derived from them still had zero matching nodes, so a search for
            a just-written fact returned an unrelated one.

        Nothing in either API tells you the thing you need to know, so both
        implementations wait for the row/node count to STOP CHANGING rather
        than for a flag or a target count. A target is wrong too: a store that
        infers decides for itself how many memories your sentences become.

        Who needs this: bulk writers who read straight back — the arena seeds
        a conversation and immediately probes it. The live agent does not call
        this; a user's next turn is seconds away and pays no such penalty.

        Returns True if it settled, False on timeout. Never raises: a backend
        that cannot confirm readiness should degrade to a slower answer, not
        take the caller down.
