"""Semantic memory — durable facts, keyword-searched with SQLite FTS5.

The Hermes insight from the whiteboard: "keyword top-k, no embedding". For a
single user's facts, ranked keyword search (BM25) is fast, fully local, and —
crucially for teaching — you can read the whole index with sqlite3.
Want vectors? Set WAKU_SEMANTIC_STORE=supabase (see supabase_store.py).

# never hit, which is why these tokens, and only these, are searched as
# prefixes. Turning *every* token into `token*` would quietly make "car" match
# "carpet": a worse failure than this one, because it still looks like it works.

    r"""User text isn't a valid FTS5 query (quotes/punctuation break MATCH).
    Reduce it to `word OR word OR ...` over alphanumeric tokens.

    "Alphanumeric" has to mean what the *index* means by it. facts_fts and
    episodes_fts declare no tokenizer, so they get FTS5's default — unicode61,
    which keeps every Unicode alphanumeric and folds diacritics ("München" is
    stored as `munchen`). An ASCII-only `[a-zA-Z0-9]` disagreed with that
    index, and the index was not the side that was wrong:

      * accented Latin was truncated to a fragment — "Müller" became `ller`,
        which matches nothing, so German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish
        and Vietnamese users got silently wrong answers;
      * every non-Latin script reduced to "" — and an empty query is not a
        no-op. SqliteEpisodeStore.search() reads it as "just give me the recent
        ones", so a user asking about Сергей got an unrelated English episode
        handed to the model under the heading "Relevant memory". Waku wasn't
        skipping memory for those users, it was confidently supplying someone
        else's.

    `[^\W_]` is the same set unicode61 keeps. Underscore is excluded because
    unicode61 treats it as a separator, so `waku_agent` is two terms in the
    index and has to be two terms here too, or it matches nothing.

    Everything stays lowercased, and that is load-bearing beyond tidiness:
    FTS5's AND/OR/NOT/NEAR are operators only in UPPERCASE, so lowercasing is
    what stops a user's "Alex and Bob" from parsing as a boolean expression.
