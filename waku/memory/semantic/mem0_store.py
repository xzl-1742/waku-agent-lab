"""Semantic memory, hosted — Mem0 behind the same six methods as everything else.

    pip install 'waku-agent[arena]'
    WAKU_SEMANTIC_STORE=mem0   MEM0_API_KEY=m0-...

Waku's own store is FTS5 keyword search; Supabase is embeddings you host. Mem0
is a memory service: you hand it text, it decides what is worth keeping, and it
retrieves semantically. Having all three behind `FactStore` is what makes the
Memory arena a fair fight — one agent, one model, one loop, and the only thing
that changes is where facts live.

ONE HONEST CAVEAT, AND IT MATTERS FOR ANY BENCHMARK RUN

Mem0's headline feature is `infer=True`: an LLM reads what you send and decides
what is worth remembering. This adapter passes `infer=False`.

That is not a slight — it is what the contract requires. `FactStore.add()`
promises "store this fact", and a caller that stores something must be able to
find it again. With inference on, Mem0 may reasonably decide a given sentence is
not worth keeping, and `add()` would silently become a no-op. That breaks the
conformance suite for a good reason.

So a bake-off using this adapter measures Mem0's RETRIEVAL, not its extraction.
Say so out loud when reporting numbers; a benchmark that quietly disables half a
product and then scores it is worse than no benchmark.

IDS are strings here — Mem0 hands out UUIDs. `FactId` is `int | str` precisely
so a hosted backend can pass its own back untouched (see semantic/base.py).
