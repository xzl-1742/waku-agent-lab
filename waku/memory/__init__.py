    Contributors add skills to `skills/` at the repo root: that is what
    CONTRIBUTING.md documents, what CI validates, and what a checkout has. But
    the wheel only packages the `waku/` directory, so a `pip install waku-agent`
    would have found nothing there and silently started with zero skills —
    procedural memory, one of the four pillars, quietly missing. (It did, until
    2026-07-31.) pyproject force-includes the same folder into the wheel at
    `waku/skills`, so an installed Waku finds it next to the code.

    Exactly one of these exists at a time — the package copy only in a built
    wheel, the repo copy only in a checkout — so returning both is not a
    double-load, it is "wherever you installed from, the skills came too".
