"""Pricing — what a call cost, in dollars a human can feel.

The loop writes a permanent ledger (`.waku/usage.jsonl`): one line per API call
with provider, model, and token counts. It deliberately does NOT store a price.
Prices change; tokens don't. So cost is derived HERE, at read time, from the
current tables — which means fixing a wrong rate silently corrects every past
race and every historical spend chart.

Three tables, checked in this order by `price_for()`:

  _price_cache    exact per-model rates learned from a live catalog fetch
                  (OpenRouter reports them) — see catalog.list_models()
  MODEL_PRICING   hand-maintained rates for endpoints with no listable catalog
  PRICING         a provider-level fallback, deliberately rough, labelled "est"

`MODEL_CUTOFF` is the same idea for knowledge cutoffs: the arena discloses when
each brain's world knowledge ends, so a 2025 model denying that 2026 models
exist reads as stale data, not stupidity.

Imported by the arena (per-race cost), the dashboard (the spend chart), and
`scripts/shootout.py`.
