"""Dashboard — every pillar on one local page. Zero new dependencies.

    make dashboard        # → http://localhost:7777

One stdlib HTTP server reading the files Waku already writes:
  loop + harness   traces/*.jsonl   (turns, gate decisions, tool calls, tokens)
  memory           state.db         (facts, episodes, chat log, consolidation)
  tools            state.db + calendar.ics + outbox/
  eval             eval_report.json (written by `make gate`)

The overview mirrors the architecture diagram — every box is clickable and
opens that section's live data. The chat dock is a real gateway: type (or speak)
a message and watch the same harness (gate, loop, tools, memory) that the CLI/
voice/telegram gateways drive light up in the browser as it runs.

The frontend is plain static files (static/index.html + style.css + app.js)
served as-is — no build step, no framework. This file is just the server + API.
Bound to 127.0.0.1 only. For deep trace waterfalls use Phoenix (`make trace`).
