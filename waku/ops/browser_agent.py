"""The browser gateway's agent — one Waku, shared by every tab.

The dashboard is a gateway like the CLI or Telegram: it only moves text. But
unlike those it is multi-threaded (a stdlib ThreadingHTTPServer) and long-lived
across page refreshes, so it needs two things the other gateways don't:

  ONE agent, built lazily on the first chat and reused, behind `agent_lock` so
  turns run one at a time. Correct for a single-user local tool, and required:
  the SQLite connection is shared across worker threads.

  ONE chat thread per dashboard RUN, dated, resumed on restart. Never the
  eternal "default" session — a returning user should see their conversation,
  not an infinite scroll of every chat they have ever had. `maybe_rotate_session`
  handles the other half of that: come back after an idle gap and you get a new
  thread, with the old one one click away in History. (Live bug this fixes: a
  tester came back days later and their new message landed in a week-old
  32-message thread.)

This lives in its own module because two callers mutate the singleton —
dashboard.py builds it for a chat, settings_api rebuilds it when you switch
provider — and a module global can only be rebound by the module that owns it.
Import the MODULE, not the name: `browser_agent.current()` sees the swap,
`from browser_agent import _agent` freezes None forever.
