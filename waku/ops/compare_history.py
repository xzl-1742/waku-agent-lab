"""Compare-arena history — the benchmark's OWN append-only log.

Deliberately separate from the agent's real state (state.db / MEMORY.md /
traces / usage.jsonl). A compare run is a benchmark: one prompt raced across N
models in throwaway sandboxes. It is NOT a conversation, a memory, or a
single-model trace, so it must not land in chat_log / facts / calendar (that
would pollute the Loop / Memory / Database / Ops views and undo the sandbox
isolation the arena depends on).

So it lives in its own JSONL — one line per race — mirroring the repo's other
append-only logs (usage.jsonl, traces/*.jsonl, eval_runs.jsonl). Read-mostly;
the per-model scoreboard is a simple scan, so no SQLite table is warranted.

File: ``<home>/compare/history.jsonl`` — newest last, capped to the most recent
``MAX_RUNS`` races so it stays small. This module is the single owner of that
file; the dashboard only calls append_run / load_runs / aggregate.
