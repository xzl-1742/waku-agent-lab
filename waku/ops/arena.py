"""The Arena — race several models through the SAME harness, live.

This is the Eval/LLM-Ops pillar made visible. One message goes to N models at
once; each contestant runs the REAL loop — retrieval gate, tools, memory — in
its own throwaway home, so a race can create events and save notes without ever
touching your actual data. That isolation is the whole reason this is safe to
demo: `.waku/` is never opened here.

    prompt ──┬─→ model A ─→ own temp home ─→ gate · tools · reply ─┐
             ├─→ model B ─→ own temp home ─→ gate · tools · reply ─┼─→ SSE
             └─→ model C ─→ own temp home ─→ gate · tools · reply ─┘

Two scores, deliberately separate:
  Completion  deterministic — did the right tool fire, with the right args?
              (waku.ops.scoring, only for prompts in the battery)
  Quality     an LLM referee's grade (waku.ops.judge), run AFTER the race as one
              gentle pass so a burst of concurrent calls can't 429 half of them.

Results land in the arena's own JSONL scoreboard (waku.ops.compare_history) —
never state.db. dashboard.py owns the HTTP/SSE plumbing; this module owns the
race.
