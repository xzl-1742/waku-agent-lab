"""Tools that let the agent manage its OWN memory — so it feels like a personal
assistant that learns, not a black box. Three tools:

  manage_memory  — search / update / delete facts and episodes (the CRUD)
  update_soul    — append a durable behaviour rule to SOUL.md (its persona)
  create_skill   — write a new SKILL.md, so the agent builds its own procedures

Everything writes to the same local files the dashboard shows; nothing leaves
the machine. update_soul is append-only (the agent can't delete its own honesty
rules); a human does full rewrites in the dashboard.
