"""Roadmap tools — the whiteboard boxes beyond the flagship task.

One of them is now ALIVE: `delegate_task` (the Sub-Agents box) hands a coding
job to pi (https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) — a minimal open-source coding
agent by Mario Zechner — through its headless print mode (`pi -p "task"`).
The division of labor is the teaching point: Waku is the orchestrator (memory,
working-memory assembly, evals, the human's context) and pi is the specialist
contractor (read/bash/edit/write, pure coding craft). Waku hires; pi codes;
Waku's release gate can then inspect the work.

v2 is now wired: when pi supports `--mode json` we run it that way and get its
native event stream on stdout — one JSON object per line. Two things fall out:

  * OBSERVABILITY — curated events (tool calls, text deltas, turn ends) are
    relayed through the loop's observer as kind="subagent", so the dashboard
    can show the sub-agent working live instead of a black box that returns a
    summary. (pi's own critique of built-in sub-agents, answered.)
  * HONEST COST — pi's per-message token usage is appended to the SAME
    usage.jsonl ledger as the loop's own calls (kind="subagent"). Before this,
    a delegated coding run burned tokens the arena never counted, silently
    understating every coding score's cost.

Older pi builds without --mode json fall back to the plain `-p` text path.

The other three boxes are still SKELETONS on purpose: each shows the *shape* of
a capability and returns an honest "coming soon" (terminal/browser tools need a
real sandbox + safety surface first). Everything here is OFF by default; set
`WAKU_EXPERIMENTAL=1` to register these tools.
