"""`waku mcp` — which servers are configured, and who you are signed in as.

Two agents pointed at the same memory server, signed in as two different
people, look exactly like a broken server: you write something in one and the
other cannot find it. That happened, and the reason it cost an afternoon is
that nothing anywhere printed the account. The token was on disk the whole
time with the email inside it.

So this command's first job is not switching accounts, it is *showing* them.
Switching is the easy part once you can see there is something to switch.

    waku mcp                 what is configured, and who each server knows you as
    waku mcp login <name>    sign in again — as someone else, or after expiry
    waku mcp logout <name>   forget the token; the next run signs in fresh
