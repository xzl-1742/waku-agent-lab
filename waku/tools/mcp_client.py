"""MCP connector — plug any Model Context Protocol server into Waku's tools.

Waku's loop is synchronous; the MCP SDK is async. The bridge below runs one
asyncio event loop on a daemon thread, holds every server's session on that loop
via a single AsyncExitStack (anyio requires the stack be entered/exited on the
same task), and lets the sync loop call tools via run_coroutine_threadsafe.

Config: WAKU_HOME/mcp.json — two transports, picked by which key is present.

  stdio: the client launches the server as a local subprocess.
  {"servers": [{"name": "fs", "command": "npx",
                "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"],
                "env": {}}]}

  Streamable HTTP: the server is already running, somewhere else.
  {"servers": [{"name": "waku_memory", "url": "https://host/mcp",
                "auth_env": "WAKU_MEMORY_API_KEY"}]}

A remote server is authorised one of two ways, and naming both is refused:

  "auth_env": "VAR"   a long-lived key, held in an environment variable
  "oauth": true       the browser flow — no key to issue, none to hand over

`auth_env` names an environment variable, and never holds the credential
itself: mcp.json is a config file people paste into bug reports, and a
bearer token in one is a leaked credential. The variable's value is sent as
`Authorization: Bearer <value>`.

`oauth` signs in through the server's own page on first use and keeps the
result under WAKU_HOME/mcp-auth/. Nothing has to be issued out of band, which
is what makes a remote server installable by someone who does not know us.
See mcp_oauth.py.

Streamable HTTP is the MCP spec's transport for remote servers. The older
HTTP+SSE transport is deprecated and is deliberately not supported here.

Each server's tools register as `<server>_<tool>` on the ToolRegistry. A server
that fails to connect is skipped with a warning — Waku still starts.
