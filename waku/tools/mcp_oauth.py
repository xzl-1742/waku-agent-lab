"""OAuth for remote MCP servers — the browser flow, and where the tokens live.

A remote server can be authorised two ways. `auth_env` names an environment
variable holding a long-lived key: simple, but somebody has to issue the key
and hand it over, which does not survive contact with a stranger. This module
is the other way — the one MCP's own authorization spec describes. The user
runs waku, a browser opens, they sign in on the server's own page, and no
secret ever passes through a human's clipboard or a config file.

Nothing here is waku-specific. It is the standard flow: discover the
authorization server from the resource's metadata, register this client
dynamically, open the browser, catch the redirect on loopback, exchange the
code. The SDK does all of it; this file supplies the three things the SDK
cannot know — where to keep the tokens, how to open a browser, and how to
catch the callback.
