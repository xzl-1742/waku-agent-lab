"""Google Calendar — read your real schedule, with a sign-in you can actually do.

Two OAuth-client sources, with the same read-only access:

  DEFAULT   waku's own OAuth client, shipped below. Click, approve in the
            browser, done. No files to download.

  OVERRIDE  your own `.waku/credentials.json`, when present. This replaces the
            OAuth client configuration only; it does not expand permissions.

Why the read client can live in a public repo: for Google's "Desktop app" OAuth
client type the secret is not confidential, and Google says so. It identifies
the app, it does not authorise anything. Nobody can read your calendar with it;
every user still approves in their own browser and their token is stored only on
their machine. This is what gcloud and rclone do. The blast radius of a leak is
brand impersonation and quota, not data — which is exactly why READ is shipped
and WRITE is not.

Everything here is best-effort and honest: a missing dependency, a refused
consent or an expired token returns a sentence explaining what to do, never an
exception, because a calendar hiccup must not take down a chat turn.
