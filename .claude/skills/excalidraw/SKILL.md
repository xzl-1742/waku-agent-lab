  Generate an Excalidraw whiteboard in Sean's hand-drawn video style (Excalifont,
  roughness 1, green signature, socials + watermark, source labels). Use whenever
  the user wants a whiteboard, diagram, teaching board, or "chart" for a video or
  the docs/whiteboards gallery or a lab/ topic — anything Sean will film with.

# Excalidraw whiteboards, Sean's way

Boards are generated from code so they match the masters in `~/Developer/Excalidraw`
exactly — Sean films with them directly. Never hand-write `.excalidraw` JSON; use the
style engine, which locks the values that a from-scratch board always gets wrong.

## The five things a naive board gets wrong (all fixed by the engine)

1. `fontFamily 5` (Excalifont) — NOT `1` (legacy Virgil). Wrong font = wrong board.
2. `roughness 1` (controlled) — NOT `2` (scratchy).
3. Stroke-width hierarchy `1` detail / `2` container / `4` emphasis — not flat `2`.
4. Type scale = Excalidraw presets S=16 / M=20 / L=28. Majority is S/M;
   L (28) reserved for big titles only. Don't inflate past the presets.
5. Signature green `#b2f2bb`, frames, socials block, watermark, source labels.

## How to build one

```python
from scripts.whiteboard import style as S   # run from the repo root

e = []
e.append(S.text(60, 40, "Title", size=S.FS_TITLE))
e.append(S.underline(64, 120, 800, color=S.PAL["orange"][1]))
e += S.labeled_box(80, 200, 300, 140, "A box\nwith a note", color="green")
e += S.pill_header(80, 400, 600, "SECTION", color="blue")
e += S.ellipse(500, 200, 180, 120, "agent", color="pink")
e += S.diamond(700, 200, 140, 100, "gate?", color="green")
e += S.labeled_arrow(380, 270, 500, 260, "tool calls")
e += S.socials_block(1980, 44)
e.append(S.watermark(80, 1030))
e.append(S.source_label(80, 900, "per <vendor>, <date>"))   # standing rule
e.append(S.red_note(80, 960, "honest red-ink opinion"))     # standing rule

S.validate(e)                       # catches broken bound-text ids
doc = S.document(e)                 # wraps with appState + white bg
```

Where the board goes depends on who it is for:

- **A board that explains Waku's own code:** write it to `docs/whiteboards/<name>.excalidraw`.
- **A board for a video** (anything a `lab/` topic films): the `.excalidraw` source and the
  script that draws it go to `~/Developer/Excalidraw/waku-lab/<topic>/`, **never into the
  repo**. Commit only a PNG screenshot, to `lab/<topic>/screenshots/<name>.png`.
  `evals/deterministic/test_rulebook.py` fails if a `.excalidraw` file appears in a lab topic.
See `lab/kimi-k3/build_k3_tutorial.py` for a full two-board example.

## Palette (name → fill/stroke), meaning follows Sean's color system

- `green` loop / hero / final reply · `red` harness boundary / cost / honest-ink
- `blue` LLM-ops / observability · `orange` a loop step · `pink` LLM/agent nodes
- `grey` neutral state/config · `yellow` callout · `plain` bare container

## Always, before delivering

1. `S.validate(elements)` — every bound text must map to a container.
2. Eyeball via SVG proxy → PNG (QuickLook crops wide canvases; use headless
   Chrome `--screenshot --window-size=W,H` for the full board). Check for
   overlaps and off-canvas elements.
3. Shareable boards get the socials block + `@ShenSeanChen` watermark.
4. Every technical/vendor claim gets a dated `source_label`.

## Two ratios, measured from the masters — check yours before delivering

Generated boards fail in the same two ways every time. Both are countable, so
count them instead of eyeballing:

```python
# against ~/Developer/Excalidraw/<newest>.excalidraw
black strokes / all shapes   ->  masters: 96%   (354 of 368)
arrows / all shapes          ->  masters: 0.88  (241 arrows, 165 ellipses)
```

1. **COLOUR POLLUTION.** The masters are ~96% BLACK strokes with transparent or
   white fills. Colour lands maybe fifteen times on a whole board: green
   `#b2f2bb` for the hero, red `#ffc9c9` for the warning, and a handful of
   coloured strokes on section boundaries. A first-pass generated board
   typically comes out at 3% black — a coloured stroke on every shape. Ink by
   default; a fill has to earn its place. Note `labeled_box(fill="chip")` is
   documented as user-prompt/reply chips ONLY, and using it for general boxes
   is the usual cause.

2. **NO FLOW.** The masters average nearly one arrow per shape, with ellipses
   for agents and diamonds for decisions. A board of boxes in a grid with two
   arrows is an infographic, not a whiteboard — it reads as dead. If the
   subject has motion, DRAW the motion: fan-outs, back-edges, branches from a
   diamond. A back-edge that visibly returns is worth more than a paragraph.

Fix both before showing it, because they are the first things Sean notices.

## Layout lessons (from comparing generated vs. hand-drawn)

- Poster-tight beats sprawl for a single teaching idea — fit it in one landscape
  frame (~2500×1100) so it reads without panning. Reserve the 8000×20000 sprawl
  for full system maps.
- A diagonal "ladder" reads as progress; a red barrier + a green break-through
  reads as problem→solution. Reuse those two shapes.
