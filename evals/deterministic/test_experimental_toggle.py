"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the chat agent can switch experimental tools on/off.

The live bug this pins: the Arena passed `experimental=coding` explicitly, so a
coding race could always delegate to pi — but the sidebar chat built its agent
from `load_settings()`, which reads WAKU_EXPERIMENTAL from the environment.
`make dashboard` never sets it, so the chat could NEVER delegate and told the
user so. The dashboard now exposes the flag and lets settings_save write it.
