"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — working memory is a bounded sliding window.

Sean's insight while testing Telegram: its one always-on session accumulated
history forever, and every turn resent the whole thing (unbounded context ->
cost/latency climb -> eventual context-limit break). Working memory must be a
fixed window; older turns live in state.db + consolidation, not the prompt."""
