"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — /api/graph/stream, the socket behind the wave cards.

The cards in the Graph tab are only as honest as the events reaching them, and
three ways to break that are invisible until a live run:

  * a workflow name arriving from the browser gets imported and called
  * a value that json.dumps cannot encode kills the stream mid-frame, so the
    browser sees a half-finished run and no error
  * a node raises and the whole response dies instead of reporting

None of that needs a model, a network or a real workflow — a scripted graph and
a fake emit are enough. Offline, sub-second.
