"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the dashboard's static assets hang together.

There is no JS test runner (no build step, on purpose), so these cheap checks
guard the two ways the split frontend silently breaks:
  1. index.html references a <script>/<link> that doesn't exist on disk.
  2. an inline onclick=/oninput=/… handler calls a function that no js/ file
     defines (e.g. a handler was renamed or moved and a call site missed).
Both render as a dead button with no error — exactly what a Python-side check
can catch without a browser."""
