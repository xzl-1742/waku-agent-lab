"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the chat dock's "All messages" timeline.

Sean's point: the Loop tab shows every turn across all threads, but the chat
dock only showed one thread at a time, so his history felt missing. The
read-only id="__all__" history action returns the whole cross-thread timeline
(newest last), so the dock can render the full conversation like Loop does."""
