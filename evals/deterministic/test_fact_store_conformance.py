"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — every semantic-memory backend, held to the same contract.

This suite exists because the contract was never written down, so the second
backend silently didn't meet it. `SqliteFactStore` had six methods,
`SupabaseFactStore` had two, and `WAKU_SEMANTIC_STORE=supabase` therefore
broke the dashboard's memory page, the manage_memory tool's update and delete
— and worst of all made `search_with_ids` return `[]` through a
`hasattr(...) else []` guard, so the agent told users a fact didn't exist while
it sat in the database.

So the shape of this file matters more than any single assertion: it is
parametrized over BACKENDS, and every backend runs every test. Adding a store
is not "write a class"; it is "write a class that passes this". That is the
whole point of waku/memory/semantic/base.py.

The first test is the one that would have caught the original bug on the day it
shipped, and it is one line: `isinstance(store, FactStore)`. A runtime
checkable Protocol verifies the methods are PRESENT — which is exactly the
failure we had. It cannot check signatures or behaviour, so the rest of the
file does that by exercising them.

Offline by default: SQLite in tmp_path, no keys, no network. Supabase joins the
parametrization only when you opt in explicitly (see `_supabase_store`), because
its `add()` calls OpenAI for embeddings and costs real money — `make gate` must
stay green for a contributor with no accounts.
