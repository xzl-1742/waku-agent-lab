"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the ONE Completion scorer (waku.ops.scoring).

The CLI shootout and the live arena both score a run through this module, so the
terminal number and the on-screen number can't drift. These tests pin the
contract: the checklist logic, and matching a free-text prompt to its case."""
