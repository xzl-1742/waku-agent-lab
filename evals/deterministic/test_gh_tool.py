"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the gh tool's read-only boundary, proven offline.

CI has no `gh` and no GitHub credentials, so nothing here asserts "reading
really works" — that is verified by hand against a live repo. What CAN be
pinned in CI is the part that would actually hurt if it broke: that a model
cannot get a WRITE command past this tool, and that every failure comes back as
a sentence rather than an exception.

The design being defended, from the module docstring:

    ARGV IS CONSTRUCTED, NEVER FILTERED.

The model picks a label from a table of five; every other argv element is
either a literal in the source or a value that matched a regex. So the tests
below check the boundary in two independent ways — the refusal text, and the
stronger claim that the subprocess is never reached at all. The second is what
matters: a tool that spawns `gh pr merge` and then inspects the result has
already merged the PR.

Lesson carried over from test_apple_tools.py, where four tools sat broken for
weeks behind a green suite: assert on the command that WOULD run, not on prose
describing it.
