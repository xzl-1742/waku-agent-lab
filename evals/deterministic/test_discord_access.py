"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — who the Discord bot is allowed to answer.

Written after a live incident on 2026-07-26: the bot was sitting in a 32-member
server and answering EVERY message in EVERY channel it could see. The guard read

    if allowed and str(message.author.id) != allowed:

and DISCORD_ALLOWED_USER was unset — so `allowed` was "", the condition was
never true, and the whole check was skipped. The empty configuration was the
dangerous one.

That is three separate problems, and cost is the least of them:
  * every message was a billed agent turn
  * the bot answers out of the maintainer's PERSONAL memory, so anyone in the
    server could ask what it knew about him
  * chat_log feeds consolidation, so strangers' messages become permanent facts

`should_answer` is a pure function precisely so this policy can be pinned here
without a Discord connection. Every case below is a door that must stay shut.
