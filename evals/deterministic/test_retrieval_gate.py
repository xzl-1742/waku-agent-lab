"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — hero 1: the gate that decides whether to search memory.

docs/architecture.md calls `retrieval_gate.py` hero 1, and until now it had no test. It is
the answer to the most-asked question about this repo ("why not just search
memory every turn?"), so it is the one piece that most needs to keep working.

Everything here is offline: a ScriptedClient plays back whatever the small model
would have said, so these cases pin the PARSING and the FAILURE POSTURE — the
parts that are ours. Whether a given model says true or false for a given
sentence is a judgment call and belongs in evals/judge/, not here.

The contract in one line: **the gate fails OPEN.** Anything it cannot understand
must produce "retrieve", because a stale memory beats a lost one. Every case
below either proves a clean decision is read correctly, or proves a broken one
still lets memory through.
