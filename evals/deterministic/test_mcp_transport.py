"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the MCP connector's two transports, proven offline.

The connector was stdio-only until 2026-08-26: `_connect_all` built
`StdioServerParameters` unconditionally, so a remote MCP server could not be
reached at all. This file pins the branch that fixed it.

Nothing here touches the network. The stdio case spawns the demo server that
lives in `evals/fixtures/`; the HTTP case spawns that same server in
`streamable-http` mode on a loopback port. Both are real MCP sessions over a
real transport — not mocks — which is the point: the two bugs this connector
has actually had (an SDK rename, and a transport that was never implemented)
would both sail past a mocked session.

What is deliberately NOT asserted: that a particular remote service accepts
our credential. That needs a live server and a real key, and belongs in a
hand-run check, not in CI.
