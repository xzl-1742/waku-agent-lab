"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the browser gateway's shared agent survives a swap.

The dashboard is the one gateway that is both multi-threaded and long-lived, so
it keeps a single Waku behind `waku.ops.browser_agent`. Two callers mutate it:
dashboard.py builds it on the first chat, settings_api rebuilds it when you
change provider or model. This pins the part that is easy to get wrong.

The bug this was written for: changing ANY setting rebuilt the agent, and a
fresh Waku starts on the eternal 'default' session. So one visit to the Settings
tab silently moved you into a different conversation — your chat was still in
the database, just no longer the thread the dock was showing. It looked like
data loss and was reported as one.
