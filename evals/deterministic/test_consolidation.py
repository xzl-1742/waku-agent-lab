"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the diamond on the whiteboard: consolidate, but only sometimes.

`consolidation.py` is the second half of the Memory pillar and, like the
retrieval gate, it had no test. It answers "when does a chat become a memory?"
— and the honest answer is "after N exchanges, not after every message", which
is exactly the kind of rule that quietly stops working.

Offline throughout: a ScriptedClient stands in for the summarizer, so these
cases pin the THRESHOLD, the BOOKKEEPING and the FAILURE POSTURE. Whether the
model extracts good facts from a given conversation is a judgment call and lives
in evals/judge/.

Three properties matter more than the rest:
  * below the threshold, it must not call the model AT ALL (cost)
  * a summarizer failure must never mark the log consolidated (data loss)
  * consolidated rows must never be re-read (duplicate facts)

    the broad `except`. Verified by reverting consolidation.py and re-running:
    still green. A test that passes on broken code is not a regression test.

    The only thing that actually distinguishes fixed from broken is the number
    sent to the API, so assert on that. `CountingClient` already sees the
    kwargs; nothing new is needed to reach them.

    Why 2048 and not the exact 4096: pinning the literal would fail the day
    someone tunes it upward, which is the wrong direction to defend. The floor
    is what matters — the measured failure was a 40-row backlog truncating at
    600, and 2048 was enough for it.

    This is the same trap `CountingClient`'s own docstring warns about: when a
