"""LLM-AS-JUDGE EVAL — does the retrieval gate decide correctly?

The deterministic suite (evals/deterministic/test_retrieval_gate.py) pins the
plumbing: JSON parsing, fail-open posture, exactly-one-call. None of those
tests ask whether a "yes" was the *right answer*. This eval does.

We present the gate with messages paired with a memory context, each labeled
``should_retrieve: true | false``. A judge model scores whether the gate's
decision was *reasonable* — not whether it matches the label, but whether a
thoughtful observer would defend it. Covers the four cases from issue #77:

  1. Chitchat with a full memory store — should NOT retrieve
  2. A direct question about a stored fact — SHOULD retrieve
  3. A follow-up whose referent is only in history, not memory — should NOT
  4. A question whose answer memory does not contain — SHOULD retrieve

The judge does NOT see the expected label — it independently evaluates whether
the gate's decision was defensible given the message and what's in memory.
This is a quality-scored eval (DeepEval GEval, 0–1 with threshold), not a 0/1
assertion — the difference matters, see docs/context/conventions.md §4.

Two things the issue asks for that a plain accuracy number cannot express:

**The two error directions are not symmetric.** A false NO is the expensive
one: the user told Waku something, the gate refused to look, and the fact is
silently absent from the reply. A false YES costs one FTS5 search and a few
hundred characters of prompt. So the headline is a COST-WEIGHTED score (see
``FALSE_NEGATIVE_COST``), the two directions are reported under their own
headings, and any miss prints a warning naming the case. An average that hides
which way the gate is failing is the thing this eval exists to prevent.

**A "yes" is only half the decision.** The gate returns a search query too, and
a correct yes carrying a useless query retrieves nothing — from the outside
that is indistinguishable from a correct no. So
``test_retrieve_query_would_find_the_memory`` scores the query itself.

Requires the active provider's API key: the judge is a real model call, same
as evals/judge/test_response_quality.py.

    it wrong was a live failure. The judge is shown more than the gate ever
    gets: ``should_retrieve`` is called with the message and nothing else — no
    chat history, no memory snippets, no idea what was said one turn ago. The
    judge sees the memory context, and from that vantage point "Can you make

    point it is a personal-sounding sentence with no context at all, and
    looking is the defensible move — the fail-open contract the deterministic
    suite pins. Judging a decision against information the decider never had
    is a measurement bug, not a gate bug.

    This metric passes ``evaluation_steps`` rather than ``criteria``, and that

    invent its own rubric first — and no wording of the horizon rule survived
    that step reliably. The judge kept generating a step that consulted the
    memory context and then failing the gate on it, in as many words: "the
    retrieval context suggests it could be personal (pods.ml project), but...".
    Explicit steps remove the generation entirely, so the rule cannot be

    same blind posture as ``gate_metric``.

    Two things the judge cannot infer and so is told outright: that the target
    is a KEYWORD index, and that store coverage is not the query's fault.

    Both were live failures. Told only "score whether the query would surface
    the memory", the judge scored a good query 0.2–0.5 on the
    ``missing-memory`` cases and said why in as many words: "the query
    faithfully targets the user's request [but] the retrieval context contains
    no relevant facts". That is ``gate_metric``'s measurement bug in different
    clothes — scoring the thing under test against an outcome it does not
    control. Whether the store holds an answer is a property of the store; by
    construction these cases have none, so every query would "fail" that way.

    The keyword clause is load-bearing too. Without it the judge reached for
    semantic-search intuitions and marked ``dog name`` down for "missing the
    personalization aspect ('my')" — but this query is handed to
    ``waku/memory/semantic/store.py::_fts_query``, which strips to alphanumeric
    tokens and ORs them, so "my" would buy exactly nothing. Hence the worked
    example in the steps: an anchor beats an adjective.

    Like ``gate_metric``, this passes ``evaluation_steps`` rather than
    ``criteria``. The reason is sharper here: ``actual_output`` holding a
    search query, alongside a ``retrieval_context``, is the exact shape of a
    RAG answer-quality case, so GEval's generated rubric kept inventing a step
    that demanded an answer. One run failed citing "Step 4's core requirement:
    it does not actually answer what the user had for breakfast" — a step this
    file never asked for, scoring a query as if it were a reply. Explicit
