"""Reset .waku to a clean, curated state for a demo / recording.

    python scripts/demo_seed.py                 # clean slate, KEEPS the spend ledger
    python scripts/demo_seed.py --reset-spend   # also wipe usage.jsonl (money/tokens)

What it does (your old state is backed up first, never just deleted):
  1. moves the current .waku aside to .waku.bak-<timestamp>
  2. creates a fresh state.db + calendar.ics
  3. seeds a small, clean memory (a few facts + one episode) and ONE calendar
     event — Sergey's standing Saturday 5 PM swim
  4. clears the loop/tool traces AND the Ops eval history, so the Loop, Tools and
     Ops tabs start empty and fill up live in front of the viewer as you type

The money/token spend ledger (usage.jsonl) is treated as a permanent record and
is KEPT by default — it's only wiped when you explicitly pass --reset-spend.

Everything it writes is the same data the app writes — open state.db afterwards
and it looks exactly like real use, just tidy.
