"""Whiteboard: loop vs graph engineering.

The companion picture to docs/loop-vs-graph.md.

COMPOSITION — two mirrored FLOWS on top, their measured timelines underneath.

The first version of this board led with the timelines, because timelines are
what actually prove concurrency. That produced an infographic: 27 boxes, one
arrow, nothing moving. Measured against the masters in ~/Developer/Excalidraw
it was 0.07 arrows per shape against their 0.88 — a table pretending to be a
whiteboard.

So the flow is the hero and the timeline is the receipt beneath it. The two
flows are drawn to be read against each other:

  * the LOOP is a cycle. Its signature is the arrow that goes BACK — the model
    decides, calls a tool, looks again, decides again. You cannot draw where it
    ends because it does not know either.
  * the GRAPH is a fan. Its signature is one arrow becoming four and four
    becoming one. Every edge is on the page before anything runs.

COLOUR — the masters are 96% black strokes (354 of 368 shapes) with transparent
or white fills; colour lands maybe fifteen times on a whole board. The first
version of this one was 3% black. Ink by default; a fill has to earn its place.
