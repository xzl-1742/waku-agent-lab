"""26.08.15 Memory System Anatomy — the model behind the memory-layer comparison.

The abstract board. Its companion is the harness chart (26.08.08), which shows
the SAME two components sitting inside Waku's own diagram — this one strips
everything else away so the shape is arguable on its own.

The claim it has to carry: a memory system is a STORE and a MANAGER inside a
SCOPE, and every product in the video differs only in how it answers three
questions. The vendors crowd into the store. The manager is where the empty
space is, and Job 4 is empty for everyone.
